# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the new analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. This DataFrame consised the total rides, drivers, and fares, and the average fares per ride and per driver. Then, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results:

The below image shows the summary of the PyBer DataFame. As you can see, urban cities had the highest number of rides and rurl cities had the least. However, rural citites had the highest average fare for rides, while urban cities had the least. This is showing that rural cities are charging the most money for rides, yet are experiencing lesser ride. Meanwhile, urban cities, while have to most total rides, are doing it at a cost cheaper than both rural and suburban cities.

I also created a pivot table to resample the dataframe fares for each week from early 2019 till 28th April. Below, you can see the multiple-line chart, all cities experience a peak in rides towards the end of Februray. However, overall, urban cities had more peaks than any other city type.

## Summary:
Based on the results, here are three business recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city types:
1. Lower ride fares in rural and suburban cities.
2. Increase the number of drivers in rural and suburban cities by hiring more drivers to service the population.
3. Increase the fares for rides in urban cities.
